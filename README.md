# Who doesn’t love a big, tender, juicy steakhouse burger? Problem is, they’re difficult to replicate at home because most steakhouses blend different cuts of beef — like sirloin, chuck, and short ribs — to customize the flavor and fat content of their burgers. It’s certainly possible to grind your own meat or ask your butcher for a special blend, but it’s not always practical. Fortunately, there’s an easier way. By combining ordinary supermarket ground beef with a panade — or mixture of bread and milk — and lots of seasoning, you can make steakhouse-style burgers in no time.
